                <p>In the picture above you see me on the far left along with teammates, having a private practice sessions with Coach Jay (grey shirt). Ray, Sam, and Demarcus (the three guys surrounding Coach Jay) was already Pro players and came from overseas to help us win a Pro Exposure Tournament in Orlando, FL. Coach Jay worked with many Pro and NBA players such as Michael Beasley, Quinn Cook, and Mario Chalmers.</p>
                <p>I am musically inclined, I've been playing piano since I was 5 years old and never took lessons nor can I read music, but I do understand the different sounds every key make and can play almost any song that come to mind. People consider me as an individual that play piano by ears. </p>
                <p>Nova High School Marching Band was the first curriculum I studied music in. I played in the drumline and was really talented. Although reading music is still a challenge to me, I was able to play any cadence on any drum and teach the drumline captain snare drum rudiments my first year. Consider me as Nick Cannon from Drumline.</p>
                <p>When it comes to video games, there's one partuicular game I play. Call of Duty, I thought about being a streamer on Twitch or Facebook, but I only play the game on Xbox because investing in to a gaming PC is relatively expensive. </p>

                <h1>Why Do I Want To Become A Web Developer?</h1>
                <strong><small>It All Began With Myspace</small></strong>
                <p>I believe that Myspace is the Beginning stage of Coding for people in my generation and older. I remember creating a Myspace page in middle school and trying to figure out how to add a background image along with "Crank that" Soulja Boy playing once someone went on my page. I thought it was fun and cool creating a Myspace page, clearly, Myspace was built way before it time, but it's the reason I want to be a web developer. </p>
